- **[LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/)**: Utilized as the orchestration framework to manage the flow between different components, including embeddings creation, vector storage, and chatbot interactions.
  
- **[Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured)**: Employed for robust PDF processing, enabling the extraction and preprocessing of text from uploaded PDF documents.
  
- **[BGE Embeddings from HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en)**: Used to generate high-quality embeddings for the processed documents, facilitating effective semantic search and retrieval.
  
- **[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)**: A vector database running locally via Docker, responsible for storing and managing the generated embeddings for fast and scalable retrieval.
  
- **[LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**: Integrated as the local language model to power the chatbot, providing intelligent and context-aware responses based on the document embeddings.
  
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: The core framework for building the interactive web application, offering an intuitive interface for users to upload documents, create embeddings, and interact with the chatbot.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Document Buddy App on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIAnytime/Document-Buddy-App.git
cd Document-Buddy-App

2. Create a Virtual Environment

You can either use Python’s venv or Anaconda to create a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

Option 1: Using venv

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Option 2: Using Anaconda

Follow these steps to create a virtual environment using Anaconda:

	1.	Open the Anaconda Prompt.
	2.	Create a new environment:

conda create --name document_buddy python=3.9

(Replace document_buddy with your preferred environment name if desired).

	3.	Activate the newly created environment:

conda activate document_buddy



3. Install Dependencies

Once the environment is set up (whether venv or Conda), install the required dependencies using requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the App

Start the Streamlit app using the following command:

streamlit run new.py

Note: If your main application file is named differently, replace new.py with your actual file name (e.g., app.py).

This command will launch the app in your default web browser. If it doesn’t open automatically, navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
```

### 📝 Usage

1.	Home: Get an overview of the app and its functionalities.
